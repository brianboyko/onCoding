I was neither the first, nor the last, in my class, to get an offer, but I was happy with it.  But there were some things that may annoy job seekers: why does it take so <em>french-frying</em> long to hear back from companies just to get to the phone screen?</p>\\n<p>At cycorp, we're trying to build-out the Node.js/Javascript dev team a little more, as we currently have 2 developers for everything that requires a web interface.  And <em>everything</em> requires a web interface.  So, about four months into the job, I'm now on the other side of the desk, reviewing resumes.  </p>\\n<p>Here's why I haven't called you, if you've happened to apply to the job:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>» We got about 30 applicants for the position.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Of those thirty applicants, all of them had basic knowledge of web development - or at least claimed to on their resumes.

We didn't knock anyone for listing jQuery as a skill, in fact I'd say it's required, just to understand DOM manipulation. But it was surprising how many people had a resume chock-full of jQuery. Now, if they sent us a resume full of jQuery, or full of PHP experience, or experience with the Microsoft .NET stack and <em>wrote in their cover letters</em> that they primarily used jQuery/Angular/PHP/.NET/whatever, then that would have been fine. What was suprising was the number of resumes sent without cover letters at all that were bad fits.  These didn't take up much time, but they still had to be sorted through.  </p>\\n<p>Another third of applicants had some relevant experience, but not enough, and we couldn't verify from their work that they had listed that they had done anything approaching the scale or complexity of what we needed.  These applicants took up a bunch of our time, because while a lot of them did have \\\"javascript\\\" and \\\"front-end web design\\\" experience, a look at their personal websites, LinkedIn pages, and GitHub repositories made us realize that the only coding they'd ever done was for their friend's wedding or for their church, mostly using pre-bought WordPress templates.  Don't get me wrong, that's where a lot of software engineers (myself included) start, but that's a far cry from begin a software engineer.</p>\\n<p>So that left us with about a third we put into a stack called \\\"Promising.\\\"  So what's up with that?</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>» I can't tell how well you can code from your resume.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you're in marketing, it's relatively easy to gauge your skill level.

Do they take on different technologies, different frameworks, and different programming languages or do they just stay there, immobile?</p>\\n<p>I don't fine-tooth-comb everything, but I look for red-flags and green flags.  Green Flags: Things like unit tests. Team projects (either OSS contributions or small teams).  Red Flags: a 7000-line file called \\\"MyApp.js\\\".

Since Skyler has worked at the company longer and has more of an idea of what skills we need long-term, in many ways we've got to proceed through him -- and we just can't do that when he's sick.
