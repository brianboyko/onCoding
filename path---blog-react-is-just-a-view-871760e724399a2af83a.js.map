React instead suggests that the \\\"separation of concerns\\\" be separated, instead, by small, discrete, reusable building blocks called Components. Each component has it's own view (usually found in the render() method), it's own controllers (the various handlers and lifecycle event handlers built into React) and it's own model (the component state.)
